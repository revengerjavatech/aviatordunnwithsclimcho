## What Is the Aviator Game?

Aviator is a crash game that operates on a simple yet exciting premise:
players bet on how high the multiplier will go before the plane
(symbolizing the multiplier) flies away. The longer you wait, the higher
your potential win---but you must cash out before the plane takes off.
This combination of strategy, risk, and high rewards makes the game
appealing to many gamblers.

The game is available across a wide variety of online casinos in India,
including well-known platforms like Parimatch, Rajabets, Pin-Up, and
